## Introduction

Online toxicity is a significant problem that can hinder constructive conversations. This project aims to address this issue by building a robust system to identify and flag toxic comments. The core of this project is a Streamlit application that allows users to analyze comments in real-time or in bulk by uploading a CSV file. The included Jupyter Notebook (`test.ipynb`) offers a detailed walkthrough of the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Features

*   **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly dashboard for easy interaction with the models.
*   **Real-Time Prediction:** Instantly classify the toxicity of a single comment.
*   **Bulk Prediction:** Upload a CSV file with a `comment_text` column to get predictions for multiple comments.
*   **Model Selection:** Choose between a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predictions.
*   **Comprehensive Jupyter Notebook:** A step-by-step guide covering the entire model development process.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhampandey1git/Deep-Learning-for-Comment-Toxicity-Detection.git
cd Deep-Learning-for-Comment-Toxicity-Detection
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install the required libraries:**
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

```
tensorflow
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
joblib
```

**4. Download NLTK data:**
Run the following commands in a Python interpreter:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## How to Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can launch the Streamlit application with this command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your default web browser will open a new tab with the application running.

### Using the App

*   **Single Comment Prediction:**
    1.  Type or paste a comment into the text area.
    2.  Select either the "CNN" or "LSTM" model.
    3.  Click "Predict" to view the toxicity probability and classification.

*   **Bulk Prediction from CSV:**
    1.  Use the "Browse files" button to upload a CSV file.
    2.  The CSV file must contain a column named `comment_text`.
    3.  The app will display a preview of the predictions and provide a button to download the results.

## Model and Data Details

### Data

The models were trained on the `train.csv` dataset, which contains comments labeled for different types of toxicity. For this project, these labels were consolidated into a single binary target: `1` for any toxic label and `0` for non-toxic.

### Preprocessing

The text data undergoes several preprocessing steps:
1.  **Lowercasing:** All text is converted to lowercase.
2.  **Punctuation and Special Character Removal:** Non-alphabetic characters are removed.
3.  **Stop-word Removal:** Common English stop-words are filtered out.
4.  **Lemmatization:** Words are reduced to their root form.

### Models Trained

The `test.ipynb` notebook details the training of three models:

1.  **Logistic Regression:** A baseline model using TF-IDF features.
2.  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** An RNN architecture well-suited for sequential data like text.
3.  **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** A 1D CNN for extracting local features from word embeddings.
